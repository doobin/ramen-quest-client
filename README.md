* React

## Development Process

At the start of the project, I reviewed the requirements documentation (in full detail) and developed a game plan accordingly.

**Game Plan**

1. Planning
  * Wireframes
  * User Stories

2. Development(Stage1)
  * Basic User Interface Design (React and CSS)
  * Create UI components (Map, Sidebar)

3. Development(Stage 2)
  * Connect UI components with Google Maps and FourSquare API
  * Display data on UI from third party API's (Map, Pins, Information window)

4. Development(Stage 3)
  * Build Backend API using Express and MongoDB
  * Create RESTful routes (Get, Post, Patch, Delete)
  * Test API using curl scripts

5. Development(Stage 4)
  * Create components on UI to show, add, update, and delete data
  * Implement Final User Interface Design (CSS)


6. Deployment
  * Deploy a functional single page application that meets requirements.


My problem-solving strategy was to solve one problem and move on to the next one. Foresee problems during my planning process and plan my game plan accordingly. I used all available resources, including the internet (StackOverflow, Google, MDN, etc), other developers and instructors during my development process.

## Future Updates

* Update User Interface with CSS and Material UI
* Implement star rating system, work on User Experience
* Save venues to "want to go" and "been there" list.
